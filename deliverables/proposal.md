# Proposal
Matt Ryan

## Question/need:
The *Dune* series by Frank Herbert has often been lauded as the foundation of modern science fiction literature and generally widely influential in pop-culture. Though many fans of Herbert's writing have praised all 6 of the original Frank Herbert installments in the franchise, the sequels (installments 2-6) have not escaped criticisms for lack of accessibility and an alleged general lower quality of writing relative to the first *Dune*. With that in mind, in this project I want to attempt to examine topic/thematic differences among all books 1-6, as well as between book 1 and books 2-6 with the hopes to highlight observable and significant thematic/topical differences.


## Data Description:
I will be using the text composing books 1-6 of Frank Herbert's *Dune* series. I was able to find the each of the books in PDF format on [kingauthor.net](kingauthor.net).

## Tools:
- sklearn for NLP (CountVectorizer, TruncatedSVD, NMF)
- tableau for visualization
- pandas for data processing/manipulation
- numpy

## MVP Goal:
I hope to achieve for a minimum viable product an initial evaluation of topic modeling on our corpus as well as a brief look into topic relationships to each document.
